        <div>I am a former service and hospitality industry professional and manager excited about my entry into the field
          of web development. I am currently a student enrolled in an online coding bootcamp hosted by the University of
          Pennsylvania. I live in Philadelphia, PA, where I have resided since graduating from Temple University some
          time ago. After being laid off as a result of COVID19 in 2020, I quickly realized that the world was changing
          with regard to how people conduct business, and that it was time for me to change as well. Gone are the days
          of handshakes and face to face interactions, replaced by Zoom meetings and “contact-less” deliveries. I am
          hoping to find an opportunity that enables me to utilize my strong organizational and planning skills attained
          from my years as a customer service manager, as well as my creativity and desire to be challenged by a new
          endeavor.
          I have been playing the piano since I was young, and really enjoy doing so in my spare time. And if I am not
          attempting to crack some code, I am probably taking a run, trying out a new recipe in the kitchen, or just
          hanging around with my two cats Lynx and Malley.
